      <h2>Asphalt Repair:</h2>
      <p>Sealing a driveway doesn't significantly prolong its life, but promptly filling in cracks and holes will. If you require reliable asphalt maintenance, Ottawa homeowners and businesses are invited to give the pros at Bright & Right Line Painting a call. Crack filling prevents rain and moisture from seeping through the pavement, thus helping to prevent failure or erosion. Don’t hesitate to contact us and receive a free price quote.</p>
